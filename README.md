# Semantic-Similarity-Algorithm

We have developed semantic similarity algortihm, which given a word that is part of the English language tries to find semantically
related entities from the web ontologies ConceptNet, DBpedia, and WordNet. Moreover, the algorithm classifies each entity based on the 
properties that exist in the ConceptNet Knowledge Graph. Additionally, with respect to each property the entities are sorted based on
a semantic similarity metric that takes into consideration the similarity of DBpedia commnet Boxes, the WordNet path distance, and 
the crowdsource defined weights from ConceptNet. We could say that our algorithm is in the field of Semantic Mathcing Algorithms.
